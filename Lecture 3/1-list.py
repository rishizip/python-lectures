# list in python
# list are mutable
# we can access list upto the range of the list i.e len()
# it's kinda same as array
# it can store diff. data types

# marks = [78.5, 79, 88, 91, 99.5, 93]
# print(type(marks))
# print(marks)
# print(len(marks))

# list also have their index's and it also starts with zero
# print(marks[0])
# print(marks[4])

student = ["rishizip", 19, 6.2, True]
# list can store different type of data
print(student[0])
student[0] = "zipfiles" # we can change elements in list
print(student)
